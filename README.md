# Making-Correllation-Using-a-Dataset
**Objective**
<br>To learn and understand Correlation in python
<br>
<br>***Problem Definition***
<br>- Create a Dataframe with given range of numbers and
<br>  create a heatmap of that dataset and find its correlation
<br>
<br>- Create a dataframe with columns Feature-1, Feature-2, Method, Corr value 
<br>& Use the above dataframe to find realation between the Features
<br>
<br>**Approach/ Methods**
<br>Creating an dataframe and using libraries to interpret the data
<br>like seaborn for making heatmap, pandas, statistical libraries
<br>
<br>**Observations**
<br>Used Pandas for making the dataframe
<br>Used seaborn for creating Heatmap
<br>Using Inbuilt Display function to display the dataframes
<br>using scipy for finding correlations
<br>
<br>**Results**
<br>
<br>*• Better Analysis of Datasets 
<br>• Data Representation
<br>• Less Writing of Code
<br>• Efficiently handling huge data
<br>• Considered as one of the useful library for analyzing data*
<br>
<br>**Learning & Reflection**
<br>Better understanding of different types of correlation in Python
<br>
